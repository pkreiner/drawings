I should put these on a webpage.

For now, to see these, you'll have to download and run them yourself. The only dependency is paper.js, which I've just included for simplicity. All you need to do is git clone the repo, then run a server (I use python's SimpleHTTPServer) serving the root directory of the repo, then navigate to one of the html files with a browser.
